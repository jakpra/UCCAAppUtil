# Utility scripts for UCCAApp

This repository contains a few scripts for creating and downloading user tasks from UCCAApp, formatting them for use in spreadsheets or creating confusion matrices, and sampling and splitting text into passages for upload to UCCAApp.

## Contents

* get_sentences.py: Script for fetching sentences from a corpus, according to a list of sentence IDs (contained in a file, one ID per line). Use -v to invert.
  * usage: python get_sentences.py CORPUS SENTENCE_IDs
* get_tasks.py: Download user tasks from UCCAApp according to a list of task IDs (either as a space-separated list with --ids, or as a file, one ID per line, with --file). Outputs retrieved tasks in JSON format, which can be further processed using  tabulate.py.
  * usage: get_tasks.py \[-h\] \[-i IDS\] \[-f FILE\] username password
* helpers.py: Collection of helper functions.
* sample.py: (Randomly) sample sentences from STREUSLE corpus, w.r.t. either type balance (as many different preposition types as possible), or unit density (as many prepositions as possible). The CORPUS\ file has to have PSS unit identification as generated by identify.py from th\e streusle github repo.
  * usage: python sample.py CORPUS FORMAT OUTPUT_FILE \[many\] MAX_SEN\TS
* split_passages.py:
* streusle2ucca.py: 
* tabulate.py: Convert UCCAApp user tasks (as retrieved by get_tasks.py) from\ JSON format into human-readable table format (use 'lex' flag) and/or creates\ confusion matrices and calculates agreement (use 'conf' flag).
  * usage: python tabulate.py TASKS \[lex\] \[conf\]
